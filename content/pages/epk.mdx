After a successful career in software, Jesse MacFadyen channels his lifelong passion into a solo project that’s both ambitious and deeply personal.

Rising J, is his alter ego. He bridges alt-rock swagger with introspective artistry. Known for clever, self-aware lyrics, his music dances freely from intricate art folk to heavy stoner grooves, with a focus on pure guitar and imagination.

Jesse has always been a disruptor.  Never content to follow, always exploring with his music being quiet, gentle, subdued, until it isn't, then it's electric. With Rising J, the song always comes first. From alt-rock anthems to intimate introspective singer songwriter, it all flows purely and freely.

A lifelong dreamer and writer, Jesse is moving his creations from his singular imagination into shared reality.
