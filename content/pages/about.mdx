title: About the J
description: What's in a name?
---

I've had many names, some I've given myself, some I have earned; 'Jester'.  Through my software development career I have gone by the moniker `purplecabbage` _(long story)_.  I have chosen to release my music under the artist name __Rising J__, as in Jesse, ahem, me ... _on the rise_. Names aside, everything you read here comes from me personally, I'm not trying to be secretive, I just like to be mysterious and enigmatic sometimes.

I've been writing music for a long time, and doing everything myself, but it has mostly just been for myself.  Now I feel like I'd like to share so I will be putting more and more of my music out into the aether, and writing about it here.  I'm not really a marketer, but I would like to explain my thinking, my intentions, my motivations behind my music as I release it. Mostly the non-obvious questions you might be left with after listening to one of my songs. You can always come here to learn more about it as this site will serve as a companion to my releases.  Ideally every song becomes a conversation here.

Why do I do everything?  I have been pursuing a singular vision.  I think some of the most interesting art is created by individuals who go deep within themselves and present a single point of view.  Involving more creators can definitely produce a more marketable product, corners get rounded, thoughts get refined, clarified, etc. but I myself have always sought out the raw, straight from the tap, single source of truth versions.  That said, I would like to produce more, and that will likely mean I relax my stance and strive to use the help of others while remaining in creative control.  This will mean articulating my vision to others so they can contribute to it.

What can you do for me?  I'm glad you asked.  I am not only releasing my music to streaming platforms, _(and purchase)_, but I am also looking for sync opportunities in film, tv and games.  When a music supervisor hears a song that they are pitched, _(assuming they like it)_, they immediately start thinking of how they can catagorize it.  A useful way of making music fit in one of their buckets is to provide a list of sounds-like artists.  Very often scenes are cut with well known music that would be too expensive to license, so the music supervisor then needs to go look for a replacement.  In addition to getting feedback on my music, and telling me what you like, it would be very useful to know who you think I sound like.  This is one of the hardest questions for an artist to answer about themselves, because we all think we are unique and we are too close to see our own similarities.
