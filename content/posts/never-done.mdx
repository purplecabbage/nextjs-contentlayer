There’s a saying in software development: "Software is never done." My buddy Brian Leroux dropped that line on me, but I'm sure it’s been around long before. The point? Even after an app, program, or service is released, you're still working on it—whether it’s bug fixes or new features. A year after launch, an app might look very different from version 1.0.

### Beta Versions

Google *infamously* slapped a "beta" label on Gmail’s logo for years—so long, people wondered if it would ever go away. Beta is a software term for something close to release but shared with a smaller group of early users. That tag stayed so long, it became part of the brand’s identity.

### What If We Applied This Practice to Music?

#### There Must Be Examples

Metallica's constant repackaging of "Unforgiven" is a perfect example—though they’ve never quite captured the magic of the original. But that’s another story.

An acoustic version can breathe new life into a track, making fans fall in love all over again. This is probably the most accepted way for an artist to release a version 2.0. Eric Clapton’s "Layla" on the *Unplugged* stage is the most famous example.

Sometimes, an artist heads back to the studio after making it big and rerecords earlier tracks. Slipknot, Tool, The Aquabats, Nirvana, Toadies—they all did this with major label budgets.

Exodus went further, re-recording their entire *Bonded By Blood* album and renaming it *Let There Be Blood*. The tempos are the same, the tracklist identical, but with only two original members, the differences stand out. Both vocalists are distinct, so you can't miss the change. The album received mixed reviews—some questioned the need, others accused the band of cashing in (it sold 2,000 copies in the US, so if that’s cashing in, more power to them). Gary Holt defended it, saying he wanted to give the songs "the benefit of modern production." I agree.

If you read [this thread](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-musical-artists-include-the-same-song-in-multiple-albums), you'd think the main reason artists do this is to make more money—*ah, the dream, because musicians do everything for money…*

The dance remix scene does this too. Once a song's initial hype fades, artists or labels release remixes, often using stems shared with other producers.

Sometimes, if you wait for the 25th anniversary re-release, you get all the demos, alternate takes, and versions. But why wait?

YouTube is full of cover artists giving popular songs a new spin. And somehow, it’s always refreshing to hear a fresh take on a classic.

### Making This the Norm

We need to make updating music as natural as releasing a remix or acoustic version.

#### The Role of Streaming Services

With streaming platforms, it's easier than ever for artists to drop alternate versions or tweak existing tracks. In the past, a new release meant a big production, but now, artists can treat their catalog as living, breathing projects.

#### Fan Engagement & Input

Imagine if artists involved fans more—through remix competitions or asking which songs they'd like to see evolve. That kind of engagement could create a whole new level of interaction.

I'm still figuring out the best way to approach this myself, but it's something I’ll be experimenting with in my own work. I’d love to hear your thoughts on how we can make this a thing. As always, my ideas are free, and I can't wait to see what you do with them.
